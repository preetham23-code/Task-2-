# Task-2-
I tried using the Spike RISC-V simulator with the proxy kernel (pk) to emulate RISC-V architecture. Running spike -d pk simulates the RISC-V environment in debugging mode, providing detailed execution output. I experimented with optimization flags like -O1 for balanced performance and stability, and -Ofast for more aggressive optimizations that prioritize speed over correctness. This setup allows for testing and performance tuning of RISC-V code without needing physical hardware.

I wrote a simple C program that adds two integers and prints the result. The program was compiled using RISC-V GCC with two optimization levels: -O1 and -Ofast. I used a Makefile to automate the process and generated object dumps with riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump to compare the machine code. -O1 applies basic optimizations, while -Ofast uses aggressive optimizations for better performance. Finally, I used SPIKE to simulate the program's execution. This process allowed me to analyze the impact of different optimization levels on the compiled code.
